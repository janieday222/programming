        "**0)** Define (def) a Python Function that takes no input and prints \"Hello World\"\n",

        "**1)** Define a Python Function that prints a message of your choice five times in a row. Please do this by putting a loop inside your function. \n",
        "\n",
        "**2)** Modify your function from the previous question so that it takes a number as input which tells the function how many times to print the message. That is, you should make your function more flexible by replacing the fixed number 5 with an input that determines how many times the message is printed. \n",
        "\n",
        "**3)** Define a function called square that takes in a number and returns the square of that number. Recall that the square of a number is just the number times itself. \n",

        "If you have done number (3) correctly, the following Python code should print 9 and 25.\n",

        "**6)** Write a short program that uses the function bigger which you just defined. Your program should ask the user to enter their age, and then ask the user to enter their friend's age. Finally, the program should use the bigger function and then print out the message:\n",
